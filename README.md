## Spatial Analytics Project Product
This repository contains the digital part of my take home assignment in the course spatial analytics spring 2023.
It aims to analyze traffic accidents in New York City using spatial analysis techniques and digital tools. By exploring the spatial distribution and identifying underlying factors contributing to accidents, the project provides valuable insights for improving road safety and implementing effective preventive measures.

# Purpose
The project focuses on exploring traffic accident patterns in New York City with a spatial perspective. It involves the collection, analysis, and visualization of spatial data related to traffic accidents. The analysis includes identifying high-risk areas, examining temporal patterns, and investigating the correlation between accidents and population density.

# Repository structure
The repository contains of two folders, data and src. The data folder contains all the neccessary data to carry out the project. The src folder contains the main R script.
Additionally, there is a requirements.txt which contains the packages needed, and a Readme file to provide overview of the project.

# Requirements
This project was carried out in the RStudio app through UCloud (version 4.3.0 or later) on a Windows 10 operating system.
The required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.

# Results
The project generates various outputs, including:

- Tables showing the total accidents per ZIP code, top 10 ZIP codes with the most accidents, and bottom 10 ZIP codes with the least accidents.
- A bar plot illustrating the hourly accident count.
- An interactive map displaying the spatial distribution of accidents in New York City.
- Calculated correlation between population size and the number of accidents.

Detailed findings and conclusions are found in the project report which was handed in through digital exam.
